                    <p className = {styles.coverLetter}>My name is Luciano Bifaretti,  I am 20 and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since I was a kid I have been really interested in technology.  The interfaces and the web designs have always caught my attention, I remember that one day I said: "When I grow up I want to create my own web page". As I am very curious, I started learning some programming basics when I was 16 and a year later, I started at "Universidad Nacional de La Plata"  "Licenciatura en Sistemas" for 2 years. Unfortunately, I was not motivated enough as I considered the program was outdated and most of the subjects were really boring for me. So,  I decided to keep learning by my own,  I spent too much time learning javascript because I realized that I wanted to be a web developer and in 2021 I decided to do a bootcamp in <a href = "https://www.soyhenry.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=HENRY_AW_SEARCH_ARG_BRAND_P&gclid=Cj0KCQiAqbyNBhC2ARIsALDwAsD4pgSIf5e-lSx1byjYM6GbxITxC1nqpRX5K5dGDNa6EmMfkVDqRjoaAnVpEALw_wcB" target = "_blank" rel="noreferrer">"soyHenry"</a>. I think that was my best decision. At first, it was very hard, It was too much information for me but the effort I made was very fruitfull because after the first 2 months I was able to do my own projects and to work also in some group ones, learning to work in a team made me feel really motivated and happy. After 4 months I graduated and now I am really excited looking for my first job in the IT world. Being honest I want to do my best in this new period of my life and specially I want to keep learning.</p>
